# To Reader,

I'm Salamoonder. This is my Github.

### What I'm currently working on
I'm currently working on SalamiCode, which is a programming language written in Java.
I'm also working on learning the Godot game engine.

### What I've worked on
My Github shows nothing in the past as of now because I'm still building up my history on this platform. I'm a bit new to things.
However, I've been programming since I was about 9 years old. I started with block coding as most children my age did and moved on to Python and Lua soon after.
With Python I made silly text-adventures and pet keeping games for fun. Pygame and the works. I was influenced by Pico-8 to learn Lua which was fun.
After checking out a book about Java, I started working on other projects again, like *creating new* Minecraft mods, and now SalamiCode. I want to learn C# and maybe C++ in the future.

### Qualifications
I'm not entirely qualified to asses my own developmental skills (also seems a bit egotistical), but I would say
- _Java_: **Intermediate**
- _Python_: **Intermediate**
- _Lua_: **Intermediate**

Plus some other languages that I've worked with but wouldn't say I'm too well versed in

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Hate this one)
- C#
- C++
- ASM

Of course, this on a scale of my own design because I'm 100% sure there are more than thousands of features that I don't even know about or *would know* how to use, so there's no accurate way to scale that.
Programming is not unique and different across languages and a large majority of the skills and effort you put into one language will carry over into another, obviously; so interpreting other languages that I haven't had
practice with isn't that far of a stretch. It's the same concepts with different keywords.

You can ask me about anything.

I'm also known as:
- Clemintine
- Salami
- Noelle

Apart from development, I also compose music and write.
<p><br>With love, Noelle (She/Her).</p>
